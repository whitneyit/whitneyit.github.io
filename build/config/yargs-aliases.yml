# These are the options that are consumed by `yargs.alias`.
# https://github.com/chevex/yargs
#
# This are the abbrievations that can be passed to `gulp`. Instead of having to
# use the full command like so:
#
# ```js
# gulp build --clean --gzip --minify
# ```
#
# You can just pass in simplified version like so:
#
# ```js
# gulp build -cgm
# ```
#
# It should be noted that the abbrievations are used on all `gulp` tasks and not
# any single task. For instance, if you passed `-g` to `gulp lint` it will have
# no affect. Yes the argument will be passed but nothing in that task is
# listening for it.
#
# Likewise, you cannot have the same character represent different words in
# different tasks. Although it is possible to setup, this project has not been
# architected that way.
